As soon as a program is executed, the runtime environment sends instructions to the computer's processor and RAM, and accesses system resources. A runtime environment provides various basic functions for memory, networks, and hardware. These functions are carried out by the runtime environment instead of the application and work independently of the OS. They include reading and writing files, managing input and output devices, searching and sorting files, and transporting data via networks.
JavaScript's runtime environment is Node, and Node's runtime environment is the operating system.

->ExpressJS is a prebuilt NodeJS framework that can help you in creating server-side web applications faster and smarter. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, scalability are some of its characteristics and since it is made in NodeJS itself, it inherited its performance as well.

In short, ExpressJS did for NodeJS what Bootstrap did for HTML/CSS and responsive web design.
